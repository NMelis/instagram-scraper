## next steps:

- add tests
- replace ''' with """ keep in mind that sometimes inside "" could be ' so it cannot be changed to '' could be replaced with regex
- improve documentation
- removing slugify dependency (the less dependencies the better, only used on one spot instagram.py line 74)
- simplify code while keeping functionality and readability
- add private message functionality
- update depreciated functions
